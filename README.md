# ticket-ballot
Web application where tickets for events can be applied for and distributed fairly.

Are you tired of tickets for events you would love to go to selling out within minutes?
The aim of this project is to find a solution where fans can easily apply for events and then tickets are later distributed fairly among those who applied. Event organisers will have an easy to use interface where they can select a distribution method that works for them.

Current plans for distribution methods include:
1. Purely random amongst applicants
2. Positive weightings given to unlucky fans who apply often but do not successfully get tickets
3. First come, first served - no application necessary
